# Project_4_Group_2
Our group decided to visualize the current state of the cost of living here in the US and make predictions for the future using a combination of machine learning and a variety of other technologies we’ve learned during this class including Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SQl Databases.
 The metric which best represents this data is the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The CPI is a metric that measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. In simpler terms, it helps us understand how the cost of living is changing for the average person.
 We built a data set from multiple sources comprising thousands of records and developed a machine learning model that predicts CPI over time using clustering algorithms like K-Means to group similar cities and offer regional insights.
Our data comes from The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a branch of the U.S. Department of Labor, which surveys thousands of households and businesses each month to collect data on prices. These prices cover a wide range of items, including food, clothing, rent, healthcare, and more. By comparing this data to a base period, the CPI is calculated and used to reflect the inflation or deflation in our economy.
Our model shows the CPI exhibits a steady increase as demonstrated in our data beginning 1980 and continuing through 2040. Over the next seventeen years, our model predicts a continued steady increase in the Consumer Price Index.

## Other Ideas:
Where2Buy - price predictor, cheapest place to buy goods (consumer packaged goods - nondiscretion)
AI inlfuence on stock market - trade timing, stability, reactions
Social media influencers predictions on economics
Media/entertainment AI influence machine learn music 
ML prediction of top 100 music genre in the next 5 years
Food & Beverage predictions on weekend restaraunts, influence on food choice 
Travel - price predictions based on air travel ticket prices, type of trips ie adventures, luxury, kids... 
Education costs prediction model for savings for college (contingent on interest, geography)

## Project Intent:
Time-Series Forecasting for Food Prices
Create a model that predicts food prices based on historical data. Use time-series analysis and explore techniques. Major city Segmentation and Market Analysis to segment cities. Use clustering algorithms like K-Means to group similar cities and offer insights into targeted marketing strategies.

## Benchmarking - FDA / USDA 5% prediction (all food prices)

Food home 
Categories: dairy, protein, carbs, veges, fruit

## Methods/Techniques:

Data analysis - Pandas
Web crawl - Beautiful Soup
Building the ML model - SKlearn
Testing - SKlearn
Offer insights to the data
    What is the predicted CPI
    What is the growth rate of food prices based on city


Creating documentation - Jupyter Notebook
