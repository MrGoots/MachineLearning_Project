# Project_4_Group_2
You will work with your group to solve, analyze, or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies we’ve learned

## Here are the specific requirements:
Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
You must use at least two of the following:

Python Pandas
Python Matplotlib
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
JavaScript Plotly
JavaScript Leaflet
SQL Database
MongoDB Database
Google Cloud SQL
Amazon AWS
Tableau

## Ideas:
1. Price Prediction Model:
Develop a machine learning model that predicts the future prices of cryptocurrencies. You can use historical price data, market indicators, and social media sentiment analysis as features. This project could involve time-series analysis, regression, and natural language processing.

2. Anomaly Detection for Trading Signals:
Build a system that detects anomalies or unusual trading patterns in cryptocurrency markets. This could involve clustering techniques to identify normal trading behavior and flagging instances that deviate from the norm, indicating potential market manipulation.

3. Sentiment Analysis on Social Media:
Create a sentiment analysis model to analyze social media posts, news articles, and other textual data related to cryptocurrencies. The goal is to gauge the overall sentiment of the market, helping traders and investors make informed decisions based on public opinion.

4. Portfolio Optimization with Reinforcement Learning:
Apply reinforcement learning techniques to optimize cryptocurrency investment portfolios. The model could learn from historical data to suggest portfolio allocations that maximize returns while considering risk factors. This project would involve implementing algorithms like Q-learning or deep reinforcement learning.

5. Fraud Detection in Crypto Transactions:
Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent activities in cryptocurrency transactions. Utilize features such as transaction volume, frequency, and geographical patterns to identify potentially malicious behavior. This project would involve classification algorithms and anomaly detection techniques.

## Outcome:
Where2Buy - price predictor, cheapest place to buy goods (consumer packaged goods - nondiscretion)
AI inlfuence on stock market - trade timing, stability, reactions
Social media influencers predictions on economics
Media/entertainment AI influence machine learn music 
ML prediction of top 100 music genre in the next 5 years
Food & Beverage predictions on weekend restaraunts, influence on food choice 
Travel - price predictions based on air travel ticket prices, type of trips ie adventures, luxury, kids... 
Education costs prediction model for savings for college (contingent on interest, geography)
