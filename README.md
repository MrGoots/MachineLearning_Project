# Project_4_Group_2
You will work with your group to solve, analyze, or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies we’ve learned

## Here are the specific requirements:
Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
You must use at least two of the following:

Python Pandas
Python Matplotlib
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
JavaScript Plotly
JavaScript Leaflet
SQL Database
MongoDB Database
Google Cloud SQL
Amazon AWS
Tableau

## Other Ideas:
Where2Buy - price predictor, cheapest place to buy goods (consumer packaged goods - nondiscretion)
AI inlfuence on stock market - trade timing, stability, reactions
Social media influencers predictions on economics
Media/entertainment AI influence machine learn music 
ML prediction of top 100 music genre in the next 5 years
Food & Beverage predictions on weekend restaraunts, influence on food choice 
Travel - price predictions based on air travel ticket prices, type of trips ie adventures, luxury, kids... 
Education costs prediction model for savings for college (contingent on interest, geography)

## Project Intent:
Time-Series Forecasting for Food Prices
Create a model that predicts food prices based on historical data. Use time-series analysis and explore techniques. Major city Segmentation and Market Analysis to segment cities. Use clustering algorithms like K-Means to group similar cities and offer insights into targeted marketing strategies.

## Benchmarking - FDA / USDA 5% prediction (all food prices)

Food home 
Categories: dairy, protein, carbs, veges, fruit

## Methods/Techniques:

Data analysis - Pandas
Web crawl - Beautiful Soup
Building the ML model - SKlearn
Testing - SKlearn
Offer insights to the data
    What is the predicted CPI
    What is the growth rate of food prices based on city


Creating documentation - Jupyter Notebook
